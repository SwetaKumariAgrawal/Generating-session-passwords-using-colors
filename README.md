# Generating-session-passwords-using-colors
This project includes creation of session password using colors
Whenever a user signs up he will have to choose a sequence of colors.
And based on this whenever he logs in to access some file he has to enter a session password using the previously chosen 
sequence of colors.
The session password gets generated using an algorithm which the user has to enter.
If the entered password matches the internally generated session password then the user gets logged in successfully.
The session password is entered by the user using yhe matrix displayed in the finalsignup page.This matrix keeps changing whenever a user logs in.
